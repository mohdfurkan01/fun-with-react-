### && (AND)

```javascript
const isLoggedIn = true;

{
  isLoggedIn && <p>Welcome back, user!</p>;
}
```

When using the && operator, it helps in conditionally rendering content when a condition is true.

If isLoggedIn is true, the message "Welcome back, user!" will be displayed.

If isLoggedIn is false, nothing will be displayed.

### || (OR)

```javascript
{
  isLoggedIn || <p>Please log in to access this page</p>;
}
```

First condition (isLoggedIn) is checked:

If isLoggedIn is true (i.e., the user is logged in), it means the first condition is true.

Since true is truthy, JavaScript will ignore the second part (<p>Please log in to access this page</p>) because the OR (||) operator only needs one true condition to be satisfied.
So, nothing is rendered, and the message won't be shown.

If isLoggedIn is false (i.e., the user is not logged in):

The first condition is false.

Since the OR operator checks the second condition when the first is false, it evaluates <p>Please log in to access this page</p>, which is truthy and will be rendered.

&&: Renders the content only when the condition is true.

||: Renders fallback content when the condition is false.
