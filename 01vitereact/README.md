### File and Folder Structuer

1. To make our React project more straightforward and focus on learning or building, we can clean up the folder structure by removing unnecessary files.

assets

App.css

index.css

Helps you understand whatâ€™s going on in your project.

Reduces clutter, especially when starting fresh.

If we need those files later (like CSS for styling), we can create them as needed.

# File Name:

Capitalized first letter (PascalCase), like MyComponent.jsx.

# Component Function Name:

Component Function Name: Capitalized first letter, like function MyComponent() { ... }.

React treats functions starting with a lowercase letter as DOM tags (like <div> or <span>). By capitalizing the component name, React understands it as a custom component.

So whsher it's create-react-app or Vite, this convention ensures consistency and avoids confusion in your React app.
