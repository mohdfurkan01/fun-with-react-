### File and Folder Structuer

1. To make our React project more straightforward and focus on learning or building, we can clean up the folder structure by removing unnecessary files.

App.css

App.test.js

index.css

logo.svg

reportWebVitals.js

setupTests.js

Helps you understand whatâ€™s going on in your project.

Reduces clutter, especially when starting fresh.

If we need those files later (like CSS for styling), we can create them as needed.
